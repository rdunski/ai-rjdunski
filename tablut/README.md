# Tablut QLearningTable Project
### This repo contains code for a QlearningTable algorithm implementation for an ancient game called *Tablut*.

> See http://tafl.cyningstan.com/page/170/tablut for more info.

### This program uses the same QLearning algorithm for both sides of the game, and pits them against each other to see which one can win the most games out of 100 (which can be modified in **const.py**)

#### To run the code, simply clone the repo and run play.py using Python version 3+

`python /path/to/play.py`

##### More explanation in the code comments.
